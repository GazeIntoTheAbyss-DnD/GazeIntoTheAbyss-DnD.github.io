Its tendency to evolve too rapidly caused it to die of a bloating cancer, and through its death, millions of its cells were spread into the Atlantic Ocean, mutating into a massive amount of sea creatures, who had all began evolving into the first, primal forms of the Evergrowth that are commonly seen today.<br>
Most of the first Evergrowth children had sunk into the coral reefs, and were spotted growing and changing through prismatic colors and shades by Atlantean divers, and were collected for their beauty (where the term "Evergrowth" came from, to denote its ever-growing nature and beauty).</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">However, when some Atlanteans had found the Evergrowth feeding and evolving from eating Atlanteans, those particular specimens were annihilated and were barred from ever entering Atlantis again.<br>
Now, the Evergrowth threat has evolved and spread across the Atlantic Ocean, representing more than 40% of surface marine life.</p></div></div></div><div class="el-h1 heading-wrapper"><h1 data-heading="Strengths &amp; Weaknesses" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Strengths_&amp;_Weaknesses">Strengths &amp; Weaknesses</h1><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><em>... is there any hope that remains?</em></p></div><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Strengths" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Strengths"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Strengths</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The Evergrowth are ever-evolving and ever-growing.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Their exact number is unknown, but all natural life on Earth can immediately realize the sinister nature of any complex Evergrowth creature, and nearly all native creatures consider the Evergrowth to be enemies.<br>
Their primary strength is in their unusually strong constitution, which permits for them to survive the harshest of attacks, in order to learn, grow, and evolve.<br>
Their secondary strength, and their most notable feature is their tendency for rapid evolution, of which they have two modes: stable evolution - which takes place over months of time, and rapid or unstable evolution, which permits them to rapidly grow tumors that may or may not be beneficial in order to have a fighting chance.<br>
Certain subspecies of Evergrowth have been noted to work in tandem, and rarely, even across species differences.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In short, expect a tough enemy that may suddenly grow exactly what it needs to survive - the worst type of creature to face, and one that may sometimes be working with others.</p></div></div></div><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Weaknesses" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Weaknesses"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Weaknesses</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Their major weaknesses are the sheer energy expenses that their lifeforms require.<br>
The first surviving primordial Evergrowth were likely "infected" plants that brought the trait of photosynthesis to all their subsequent evolutions - this provides them both with energy from the sun and their iconic, prismatic sheen.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Without easy access to sunlight, most Evergrowth shrivel and perish over the course of a week, typically becoming weaker than a standard creature of the same size by the third day.<br>
Furthermore, heat of any kind is especially lethal to them, given their bodies of aquatic creatures and their weakness to protein degradation.<br>
Perhaps in the past, there were incursions of Evergrowth on the land that were annihilated with ease, due to the easy access to flame.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In short, use heat magic and heated weapons. Prefer to engage sunlight starved Evergrowth.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h1 heading-wrapper"><h1 data-heading="History" dir="auto" class="heading" id="History">History</h1><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><em>... to learn from the past.</em></p></div><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="The First Discovered" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_First_Discovered"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>The First Discovered</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The first Evergrowth organism ever discovered was the <a class="internal-link" data-href="Evergrowth Water Lily Petal.md" href="objet-d'art/evergrowth-water-lily-petal.html" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Evergrowth Water Lily</a>, from which a petal was given as a gift from <a data-href="Athana, the Undying Prophetess" href="major-characters/athana,-the-undying-prophetess.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Athana, the Undying Prophetess</a> to <a data-href="Anagenn, the Everliving Oracle" href="major-characters/anagenn,-the-everliving-oracle.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Anagenn, the Everliving Oracle</a>.<br>
The first recorded mentions of the Evergrowth date back to two-hundred years ago, describing how Anagenn appeared to be particularly joyful one day, with a new accessory; the author had noted a new shining and prismatic petal that hung on her ear.</p></div></div></div><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Records" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Records"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Records</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The records of Evergrowth had then greatly increased in the following year, with hundreds of writings discussing the new 'trend' of wearing what were then termed 'shinies,' and later, 'Evergrowth' (coined by the pseudonymous author <a data-href="Lesvía Agápi" href="minor-characters/atlanteans/lesvía-agápi.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lesvía Agápi</a>, in <em><a data-href="Kisses of the Shore" href="objet-d'art/kisses-of-the-shore.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Kisses of the Shore</a></em>). Typical fashion during this period of time was to wear simple <em>chiton</em> (Ancient Greek and Roman traditional dress for men and women) over which Evergrowth parts were overlayed, which were often called everchiton, due to their component parts.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It appears as though most felt that this was an excellent method by which to honor ancient Greek practices of wearing <em>chiton</em>, but with the fresh taste of Atlantean hope. Indeed, there were notices of trade that were being processed, as well as licenses for Evergrowth farms under bureaucratic consideration.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That is, until the first notice of a death.<br>
The first death caused by Evergrowth was extensively documented, with irrefutable evidence given to the fact that the Evergrowth décor that the 37-year-old woman, <a data-href="Illesia Agalipus" href="minor-characters/atlanteans/illesia-agalipus.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Illesia Agalipus</a>, had owned was the one that had slowly suffocated her to death. The exact strand of Evergrowth was unknown, due to the lacking technology to analyze Evergrowth at the time, but it was obvious that the Evergrowth had attempted to kill Illesia and succeeded.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This resulted in the mass incineration of both the Evergrowth specimen that were living in all of Atlantis' cities, as well as a mandate from Athana that had ordered for all Evergrowth-related culture to be suppressed. This resulted in a time of confusion, where there were black markets for samples of Evergrowth clothing that had the rich flaunting their wealth in the form of everchiton and other flamboyant Evergrowth-derived dress and food in underground parties, an increasing number of deaths caused by improperly stored and sometimes eaten Evergrowth specimens, and an eventual destruction of all detected Evergrowth from Atlantis. Records note that this time was when Athana had exerted her power most in all of known history until that point, often cleansing hundreds of thousands of specimen from each city per day.</p></div></div></div><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Modern Views" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Modern_Views"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Modern Views</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Now, modern Atlantis considers the Evergrowth threat to be the most pressing, and has spared little expense in order to equip troops to utterly annihilate all Evergrowth samples that they may come across. Some sources claim that these new advances in anti-Evergrowth weaponry have often been turned on fellow humans - to great effect, rather than on the Evergrowth for which they were initially intended.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Even so, the Evergrowth are an existential threat to all life on the planet, and all Atlantean cities have sworn to become the bulwark that will shield humanity from this new threat from the depths.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h1 heading-wrapper"><h1 data-heading="The Evergrowth Cult" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Evergrowth_Cult">The Evergrowth Cult</h1><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><em>... in which some Atlanteans seek twisted power, and even less receive.</em></p></div><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Founding &amp; ETG" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Founding_&amp;_ETG"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Founding &amp; ETG</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The Evergrowth Cult was eventually enabled by the immensely rich during the culling of the Evergrowth specimen in Atlantis.<br>
At the time, it was known as the "Evergrowing Trade Guild" (shortened to ETG), specializing in the containing, maintaining, and shipping Evergrowth samples to the wealthy, as well as testing Evergrowth samples on the unfortunate. ETG, alone, contributed approximately 95% of all Evergrowth farming, manufacture, and trafficking, according to Athana. As the fad subsided, and the rich realized that they would be hunted down by Athana, ETG collapsed from a lack of funds and interest, remaining as a group practically in name only. Naturally, the workers of ETG - those being the dealers, growers, and traffickers - were considerably upset at this turn of events.</p></div></div></div><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Evergang" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Evergang"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Evergang</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It was at this point when ETG ceased to exist in name, being immediately replaced with the Evergang, a criminal syndicate that had a diverse collection of drugs and other illicit materials, and in particular: Evergrowth samples. Through extensive testing on the poor, destitute, and kidnapped, the Evergang discovered that Evergrowth, as a heavily-processed inhalant, was noted to be mildly hallucinogenic, though most users described it as "fishy." With little to do with the Evergrowth samples, most samples were kept frozen for another possible use-case. This was not to be, as city officials had followed suit after Athana and cracked down heavily on anything regarding Evergrowth, resulting in the dismantling of the Evergang, with their caches hidden.</p></div></div></div><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="The Formation of the Evergrowth Cult" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Formation_of_the_Evergrowth_Cult"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>The Formation of the Evergrowth Cult</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">With these Evergrowth samples remaining undiscovered for several years and Athana resting from her exertions, some Evergang members (after serving their sentences) had returned to the caches of Evergrowth. It was there that the discovery was made that unprocessed Evergrowth could "infect" humanoids, albeit with some difficulty. The process often kills the victim by suffocation, as Evergrowth buildup continues in the lungs, but several gang members were able to survive the process - until the Evergrowth suffocated even the brain, resulting in death (as confirmed by mystics, Arts and spells). Nevertheless, the Evergrowth tendency to rapidly evolve had resulted in fearsome humanoid monsters, stronger than even dozens of men as a "newborn," as many unfortunate gang members discovered.<br>
Curiously, those who had survived until the cranial suffocation had maintained a shade of their former personality, evident in certain habits or choice of weapon. With much time and education, these humanoids were able to learn Atlantean Greek and human sensibility. This resulted in the formation of the Evergrowth Cult, where the weak, desperate, and wicked had gathered together (or were forced) to worship the Evergrowth or what it could do for them.</p></div></div></div><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Cult Traits" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Cult_Traits"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Cult Traits</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">A commonality between established Evergrowth Cult cells is that there is one particularly powerful member, who had been "infected" for longer than the others. It was initially unknown as to why this was the case, but researchers have discovered that the local presence of an Evergrowth "tutor" could modify the chances of the formation of an intelligent Evergrowth humanoid from 2.35% to 97.35%. These Cults often maintain a minimum of three Evergrowth humanoids and a maximum of ten, but prefer to spread their influence in smaller cells, rather than a larger gathering. Curiously, this is likely due to the mass culling of the conspicuous Evergrowth specimen, where the survivors tended to be better at stealth, and so evolved to become better at remaining stealthy.</p></div></div></div><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Cults in Modern Atlantis" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Cults_in_Modern_Atlantis"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Cults in Modern Atlantis</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In modern Atlantis, there is an estimated 60 to 80 Evergrowth Cult cells per city, though certain days, particularly Blue Moons, can result in up to 200 cells saturating a city. These Cults have an older, powerful figure that directs the Cult's worship, with two assistants, with up to twenty (mostly) human cultists. The standard initiation process is to slowly indoctrinate new members with a mixture of charisma, drugs, and Evergrowth - to surprisingly effective results, given the nature of the Evergrowth being ideal for directed symbiosis.</p></div><div class="el-hr"><hr></div></div></div></div></div><div class="el-h1 heading-wrapper"><h1 data-heading="[Notable Evergrowth](Characters#Evergrowth)" dir="auto" class="heading" id="[Notable_Evergrowth](Characters#Evergrowth)"><a class="internal-link" data-href="Characters#Evergrowth" href="setting/characters.html#Evergrowth" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Notable Evergrowth</a></h1><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><em>... and what little is known of them.</em></p></div><div class="el-hr"><hr></div><div class="mod-footer mod-ui"></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="sidebar-right sidebar"><div class="sidebar-handle"></div><div class="sidebar-topbar"><div class="topbar-content"></div><div class="clickable-icon sidebar-collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100%" height="100%" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="3" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon"><path d="M21 3H3C1.89543 3 1 3.89543 1 5V19C1 20.1046 1.89543 21 3 21H21C22.1046 21 23 20.1046 23 19V5C23 3.89543 22.1046 3 21 3Z"></path><path d="M10 4V20"></path><path d="M4 7H7"></path><path d="M4 10H7"></path><path d="M4 13H7"></path></svg></div></div><div class="sidebar-content"></div><script defer="">let rs = document.querySelector(".sidebar-right"); rs.classList.add("is-collapsed"); if (window.innerWidth > 768) rs.classList.remove("is-collapsed"); rs.style.setProperty("--sidebar-width", localStorage.getItem("sidebar-right-width"));</script></div></div></body></html>
